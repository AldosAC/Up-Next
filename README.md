# Up Next

Up Next is your solution to that eternal question... who's up next?  Create a list of participants and Up Next will randomly draw a name from the list, dynamically updating the list to track who's gone and who hasn't.

Up Next is a one page app designed to help with group presentations where presenters are picked randomly.  At it's core though, Up Next will work with any list that you might want to work through randomly.  Core design is for a list input field, allowing you to quickly generate a list, and an "Up Next" button which will draw a random item from the list, removing it and re-ordering the list as it goes.

At the moment, the app is in its conceptual and planning stage, as I progress through the design and creation of the app this README will be updated.

Planned tech stack:
